This is for next update.

I'm going to change the Function arguments system so that you don't write
Datatypes anymore, you write variable names instead.
Basically how it happens in Python. I'm trying to go further towards this
language being a *really* high level language, one that can do complex things
with the smallest amount of code possible.
So to do that, I'm going to be changing the Function arguments system to make
it even more efficient, easier to use, and shorter in code size.

game.printToConsole : (! text) => {
    !ECHO text;
};

!ECHO game.getTime;
!game.getTime;
