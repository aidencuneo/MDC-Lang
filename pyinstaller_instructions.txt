1. Move CWD to /MDC-Lang or the parent directory of /src.

2. Use `pyinstaller src/__init__.py` on Windows.

3. Delete /build folder,
   delete /dist/__init__.exe.manifest file,
   delete /__init__.spec file.

4. Copy /src/__pycache__/* files into the newly created /dist/__init__.

5. Rename files from /src/__pycache__ and take out the `.cpython-*` parts, which leaves them as filename.pyc.

6. Rename /dist/__init__ to /dist/mdcl-v1.0.0 (replace 1.0.0 with version number).

7. Rename the executable file (__init__.exe) to mdcl.exe.

Done.
