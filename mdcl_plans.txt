Version 0 was way back when MDCL was MDC and it only really held and printed
variable data within it. (It's now called MDCL because L stands for Language).

Version 1:
    MDCL Interpreter, written in Python.

Version 2:
    MDCL Compiler, written in Python.
    Compiles to ______ (insert later when I've decided)

Version 3:
    MDCL Compiler, written in MDCL.
    Crazy, right?
    This version will be written in MDCL and compile into something that can
    be executed without MDCL.
    So from this point on, MDCL will all be written in itself.

MDCL will probably change it's name gradually over time, and it will change
a lot as a language, maybe drastically, maybe only a little bit. But it'll
still change.
