1. Move CWD to /MDC-Lang or the parent directory of /src.

2. Use `pyinstaller src/__init__.py` on Windows.

3. Delete /build.

4. Copy /src/__pycache__/* files into the newly created /dist/__init__.

5. Rename /dist/__init__ to /dist/mdcl-v1.0.0 (replace 1.0.0 with version number).

6. Rename files from the /src/__pycache__ and take out the `.cpython-38` parts, which leaves them as filename.pyc.

7. Rename the executable file (__init__.exe) to mdcl.exe.

8. OPTIONAL: Delete the __init__.exe.manifest file, or just continue as normal because it won't commit to GitHub.

Done.
